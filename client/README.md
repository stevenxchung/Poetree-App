# Poetree App

Lightweight PWA ([Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)) built with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/). This application stores "Poem of The Month" (used to publish a new one every month) since Facebook got rid of their *Notes* feature ðŸ™„. I am not sure how extensive this app should be, maybe I will add on extra features (e.g., archives) if I feel the burning desire to.

## Local Run

1. Ensure you are in the `client` directory
2. Run `ionic serve`
